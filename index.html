          <p id = "border-style-green"><strong> 1925:</strong> Malcolm Little, (Malcom X) is born in Omaha, Nebraska.</p>
          
          <p id = "border-style-red"><strong> 1928:</strong> The Little family moves to Lansing Michigan, where they are sued for eviction by a restrictive covenant that is not sold to non-caucasians </p>
          
          <p id = "border-style-red"><strong> 1928:</strong> The Home is burned down November 7, Malcolm later believes a white supremacist group was behind it </p>
          
          <p id = "border-style-red"><strong> 1931:</strong> Malcolm Littles father, Earl Little, is killed in what police term a streetcar accident </p>
          
          <p id = "border-style-red"><strong> 1938:</strong> Malcolm Littles mother, Louise Little, is diagnosed as mentally ill and sent to Kalamazoo State Mental Hospital for 26 years </p>
          
          <p id = "border-style-red"><strong> 1946:</strong> Malcolm tries to retrieve a stolen $1000 watch from a pawnshop and is arrested and charged with grand larceny, breaking and entering, and firearms possession. He is convicted and, along with Jarvis, receives an eight-to-10-year sentence. The white women have their sentences suspended, but Malcolm's girlfriend serves seven months in prison. The women refused the police suggestion to charge Malcolm and Malcolm Jarvis with rape</strong>
            
          <p id = "border-style-green"><strong> 1947:</strong> Malcolm meets a fellow convict he calls "Bimbi" in prison, who convinces Malcolm to study and learn to develop his mind. In Jarvis' words, in prison "the only way we knew how to rebel was to cram some knowledge into our brains." </p>
          
          <p id = "border-style-green"><strong> 1948:</strong> Malcolm's siblings, four of whom have converted to Islam, introduce him to the words of the Nation of Islam's leader, Elijah Muhammad, who is himself in prison for sedition and violation of the draft laws. The two men correspond, and Malcolm continues his course of study, eventually writing to the Massachusetts governor and demanding the right to practice Islam in prison. He also joins the prison debate team and begins attracting attention for his oratory. </p>
          
          <p id = "border-style-green"><strong> 1952:</strong> Malcolm is released on parole, spends one night with Ella Collins, then goes to Detroit to live with his brother Wilfred. He quickly joins the Nation of Islam and attends meetings at Detroit's Temple No. 1, one of the four temples that the Nation operates at the time. Malcolm rejects the surname "Little" as a slave name given to his family by white oppressors, and he becomes known as "Malcolm X." Dismayed that the Nation of Islam is not attracting more followers, Malcolm begins an intensive recruiting campaign with Elijah Muhammad's blessing. Soon membership in the Nation begins to soar. </p>
          
          <p id = "border-style-blue"><strong> 1952:</strong> New York Temple member Johnson Hinton is savagely beaten by police. Alerted by other followers, Malcolm joins a contingent of Muslims at the 28th Precinct headquarters in Harlem, where he demands that Hinton receive medical attention. Hinton is eventually taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital, but the Muslims refuse to disperse, which alarms police. Satisfied that his demands have been met, Malcolm disperses the crowd with a wave of his hand. He later sues New York City for police brutality and wins the largest settlement in its history. Media coverage of the Hinton incident brings Malcolm national attention, and the FBI, which has kept a file on Malcolm since 1953, now considers him a "key figure" meriting significant surveillance. Police harassment of Malcolm and his family escalate </p>
          
          <p id = "border-style-green"><strong> 1952:</strong> Elijah Muhammad, who has moved from Chicago to Phoenix for health reasons, makes Malcolm national representative of the Nation of Islam. This creates resentment among Muhammad's inner circle who do not want Malcolm to be the next leader. Malcolm is increasingly asked to lecture on college campuses (eventually he will trail only Barry Goldwater in popularity as a speaker there) and participate in television and radio debates </p>
